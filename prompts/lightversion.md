I need to update the light theme version of a Framer project to match the design in the provided reference image. 

Specifically, I want to ensure that the CSS styles are dynamically updated when the Framer light/dark theme switcher is toggled. Below are the details and requirements:

Reference Design:
The design reference is available in this Figma file: Figma Link.
Focus on the light theme styles in the Figma design and ensure the Framer implementation matches these visuals.
CSS Updates for Light Theme:

When the Framer light/dark switcher activates the light mode, update the CSS styles to reflect the light theme.

Ensure the changes include typography, colors, spacing, and any other relevant design elements.
Dynamic Theme Switching:

Use Framerâ€™s built-in light/dark theme switcher to apply the updated CSS styles dynamically.
Ensure the transition between themes is smooth and consistent.
Figma JSON Code:

Below is the Figma JSON code for reference. Use this to extract specific design tokens (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing) and apply them to the CSS:

here is figma JSON code
