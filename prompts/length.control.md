# Content Length Control Feature

Implement a content length control feature with the following requirements:

Toggle Switcher for Paragraph Length:

When the user enables the toggle switcher for paragraph length, activate the line count control for paragraphs.

Ensure the line count option is only available when the paragraph type is selected.
Headings:

Enable character count control for headings.
Ensure this option is only available when the heading type is selected.
Lists:

Provide control over the number of items in lists.
UI Controls:

Include an input field for users to manually set target length limits.
Add a progress indicator slider to visually represent the current length relative to the target.

Ensure the slider updates dynamically as the user adjusts it.

Real-Time Updates:
Ensure the Text Preview Box updates in real-time whenever values are changed via the input field or slider.

Dynamic Behavior:
The feature should dynamically enable/disable options based on the selected content type (paragraph, heading, or list).
Ensure the UI is intuitive and user-friendly.

Validation:
Provide visual feedback (e.g., color-coded indicators) when the content exceeds or meets the target length.

Edge Cases:
Handle edge cases, such as empty content or invalid inputs, gracefully.
