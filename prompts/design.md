Prompt Breakdown for AI Content Generation
Here are some structured AI prompts based on the UI components:

Language Toggle Prompt
"Create a language switcher UI component that allows users to toggle between English and Arabic while preserving their selected text generation preferences."
Text Type Selection Prompt

"Develop a button group UI component that lets users choose between 'Paragraph', 'Heading', or 'List' as the text type. The selected option should visually indicate activation while others remain inactive."
Content Category Dropdown Prompt

"Design a dropdown UI for selecting a content category. The dropdown should contain predefined options like 'Technology', 'Business', 'Marketing', and 'Science'. Users should be able to select one option at a time."
Text Preview Prompt

"Create a scrollable text preview box that displays dynamically generated text. Include a 'Copy' button to allow users to copy the content with a single click."
Paragraph Length Toggle Prompt

"Implement a switch that enables users to control the length of the generated paragraph. If enabled, the text should be longer; if disabled, it should be a standard short paragraph."
Generate & Add to Canvas Button Prompt
"Create two action buttons:

'Generate New' should generate a new text snippet based on selected options.
'Add to Canvas' should insert the generated text into the Framer design."
These prompts should guide Cursor AI or any other AI tool to develop the plugin efficiently. Let me know if you need additional refinements! ðŸš€
